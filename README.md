# Listify-Notes-App
Listify is a Notes app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), designed to simplify note-taking and organization. It features an intuitive interface for creating, managing, and deleting notes. The app's backend efficiently handles API requests and stores notes in MongoDB, enabling users to perform full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations seamlessly.
